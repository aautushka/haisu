## Synopsis

HAISU - it is a C++ junk-yard. Every developer needs one. I commit all sorts of tiny useful (hopefully) classes here. Could this grow into something bigger? Nobody knows.

I habitually use Arch Linux and MacOS for my coding. HAISU would probably compile on these platforms at all times.
